            Simple TODO (“the app”) is an Android app for keeping a to-do list. It is published by
            its developer. Questions about this policy can be sent to{" "}
            <a className="text-ink underline" href={`mailto:${site.email.support}`}>
              {site.email.support}

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ink">Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The app has no accounts, no advertising and no analytics. It does not connect to the
            internet and does not collect, send or share personal data. The app asks for no
            permissions. Everything stays on your phone.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ink">What is stored on your device</h2>
          <p>
            The tasks you type, whether each one is done, and your theme choice. You can edit or
            delete any task, or clear all finished tasks, inside the app. Uninstalling the app
            removes all of it from your phone.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ink">Phone backups</h2>
          <p>
            If you have Android&apos;s automatic backup turned on in your phone settings, Android
            may include the app&apos;s data in your own Google account backup. That is handled by
            your phone and Google under your settings, and we do not receive it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ink">Children</h2>
          <p>
            The app is a general utility. It does not knowingly collect information from anyone,
            including children.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-ink">Changes</h2>

            If this policy changes, the new version and its date will be posted on this page.
